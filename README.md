# IllusionSignal
This Repository is the home of a new Signal Module originally made for Illusion's InputActionSystem. It is fast, simple to use and reliable

I don't claim to have made one of the fastest script signal, but it is far from being slow. As I said, it was made for my IAS Library and I don't expect it to be game changing for game developpers
